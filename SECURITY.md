### Security Measures

ClearURL implements several security measures:

#### Data Protection
- **No external data transmission** - All data stays on your device
- **Local storage only** - Settings and statistics stored locally
- **No analytics or tracking** - The extension doesn't track users
- **Minimal permissions** - Only requests necessary browser permissions

#### Code Security
- **Input validation** - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secure APIs** - Uses modern Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- **Regular updates** - Dependencies and security practices reviewed regularly
- **Open source** - All code is publicly auditable

#### Privacy Protection
- **URL cleaning only** - Extension only modifies URLs, doesn't read page content
- **No personal data collection** - No personal information is collected or stored
- **User control** - Users can disable/enable features and whitelist sites

### Scope

This security policy applies to:
- The ClearURL browser extension code
- Official distribution channels (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons)
- Related infrastructure and documentation

### Out of Scope

The following are typically out of scope:
- Issues in third-party dependencies (unless directly exploitable)

- Social engineering attacks

### Recognition

We value security research and will acknowledge your contribution:
