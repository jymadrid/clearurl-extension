# Icon Generation Instructions

## Quick Setup for Development

For immediate testing and development, you can use simple placeholder icons:

### Method 1: Use Online Icon Generator
1. Visit: https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Use text "CU" with green background (#4CAF50)
3. Download and rename files to: icon16.png, icon32.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

### Method 2: Use the HTML Generator
1. Open `generate_icons.html` in your browser
2. Right-click each icon and "Save image as..."
3. Save with the correct names in this directory

### Method 3: Simple Solid Color Icons (Fastest)
Create solid green squares as temporary placeholders:
- Any image editor (Paint, GIMP, etc.)
- Create square images with #4CAF50 background
- Add white "CU" text in center
- Sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128 pixels

## Required Files
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels  
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## For Production
For final release, create professional icons with:
- Shield or lock symbol
- Clean, modern design
- Good visibility at small sizes
- Consistent branding

The extension will not load without these icon files!
